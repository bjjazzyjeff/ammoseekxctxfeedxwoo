# WooCommerce x AmmoSeek x CTX Feed Pro

This document is intended for retailers who wish to publish a product feed to AmmoSeek, and have a store hosted on WooCommerce. After attempting to use multiple plug-ins, we discovered that CTX Feed Pro appears to be one of the simplest, and most important reliable, options available to meet the 5 minute feed refresh rate.

Pre-Requisites

Active website running WooCommerce
CTX Feed Pro
AmmoSeek Retailer Account: https://ammoseek.com/get-listed/

Assumptions
WooCommerce product categories can be mapped 1:1 or many:1 from WooCommerce to AmmoSeek



High Level Instructions

CTX Feed Pro by default includes a template for AmmoSeek. This works well out of the box if you are planning on listing a single category, as defined by AmmoSeek, but can get a bit complex if you want to list one or more of AmmoSeek's categories.



Extras:

- If using any form of cache, such as CloudFlare, make sure to exclude the CTX Feed Pro directory from cache otherwise it may serve stale data to AmmoSeek
